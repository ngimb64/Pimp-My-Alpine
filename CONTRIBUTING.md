## Contributing to the project

---
### Coding Conventions
- To better understand my formatting, check out format of the existing code in the project
- No dead / commented out code should be in a pull request under any circumstances
- Put a space between chunks of logic to help visually represent what is going on
- The goal is to achieve maximum readability and documentation

### New code / feature suggestions
- Code improvements are welcomed with things to keep in mind
  - Not looking for major changes that deviate from the original concept
  - Not looking for "clever" features that are unnecessarily complex
  - New features should not cause issues with current ones and should be able to integrate without major changes

### What to do after experiencing bug
- Open the issues tab and make sure it does not already exist
- If it does not exit open a new issue:
  - Make sure to provide as much information as possible
  - Provide screenshots related to the provided information
  - Suggest steps for replication of the bug

### What to do if you decided to fix a bug
- Open up a pull request
  - ensure full context of the nature of the bug, the cause, and how it is fixed are provided
